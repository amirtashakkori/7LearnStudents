This project is a simple Android application that demonstrates how to implement MVVM architecture using Retrofit for API requests, Room for offline data caching, and RxJava for multi-threading. The application fetches a list of students from a server, caches it in a local database, and allows adding new students to both the API and the local database.

## Features

- Fetch a list of students from an API and cache it for offline use
- Add new students to both the server and the local database
- Demonstrates the use of MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns
- Utilizes RxJava for handling multi-threading tasks efficiently
- Data Binding for seamless UI updates

## Technologies Used

- **MVVM Architecture**: For a scalable and testable codebase
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to the API
- **Room**: For local database management and caching
- **RxJava**: For asynchronous programming and multi-threading
- **Data Binding**: For connecting UI components to data sources
